# QuickChar
QuickChar is an ambitious, quick character sheet index. Store, add, edit, and show off the barebones sheet needed to sit down at a table and play your favorite TTRPG. Using SwiftUI, I've been trying to incorporate the game sheets for my friend's games. I'm using SwiftData to persist user data, SwiftUI, and have been searching for other frameworks to include in future updates.

# Lent iOS
Welcome to Lent, an iOS app for lending (and borrowing!) books from your friends. This app arose out of my need to remind my friends that I lent them something and how long. This is an app for cataloguing and having a mindful grasp of the amount of time that's passed since you've borrowed or lent a book.
